Net::XMPP2 missing functionality to be RFC 3920 conform:
   - TLS: implemented, just do some extensive testing WRT blocking,
          i don't trust the current way the watchers are handled,
          i'm in fear of deadlocks...
   - SRV record lookup: weight handling!
   - errorhandling for TLS and SASL!
   - testing of send_message and send_presence!

   [not mandatory but nice: - XEP-0086: Error Condition Mappings]

Net::XMPP2::IM missing functionality to be RFC 3921 conform:
